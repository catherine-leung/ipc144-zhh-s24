* B - The & is essential in this case or your program will crash
* C - You mismatched the format code and variable type
* D - When you assign to a variable, the variable needs to be on left of = operator.  x = 5 is correct, 5 = x is not correct.
* E - Missing \"  to print " for inch
* F - Not wrong but avoid declaring multiple variables on the same line.  it is not good practice.
* G - Logical error.  You cannot make this calculation until after you read in the number of inches.  Order of statements are important.  At the place where you put this statement you do not yet know the value of measurement in inches as it has not been read yet.  Program will not go back to update the calculation.  You must move this after the scanf. 
* H - measurement in cm not correctly calculated 
* J - result not printed 
* K - inches is a whole number and should be declared and read as an int
